## The task

We created [a special file](hn_workshop.7zip) (md5 fingerprint is
`d0234706b40f2816f82801be6e85d6b0`
) to which a total of 10 flags are somehow related. All of them are easily recognizable once you find them, because they are of the form
`flag{xxx}`
, where
`xxx`
is a string made of ASCII printable characters excluding whitespaces.

Good luck and have fun!
